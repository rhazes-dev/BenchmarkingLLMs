consider: viral hepatitis, medication-induced liver injury, ischaemic hepatitis.  \\n\\n*SPLENOMEGALY (UNDERLYING CAUSE TO BE INVESTIGATED)*  \\n- Spleen size of 15.2 cm (enlarged).  \\n- Associated pancytopenia suggesting hypersplenism as a possible mechanism.  \\nAlternative differentials to consider: portal hypertension, haematological malignancy, systemic infection.  \\n\\n*RENAL CYSTIC DISEASE (POSSIBLE ACQUIRED OR POLYCYSTIC KIDNEY DISEASE – TO BE DETERMINED)*  \\n- Multiple bilateral renal cysts noted on imaging (largest measuring 2.6 cm on the left kidney).  \\n- Non-obstructing

haematocrit of 27.9%, average haematocrit of 31.51%.  \\n- Decreased red blood cell count (minimum 3.35, average 3.71).  \\n- Mitral valve replacement and significant post-operative changes likely contributing to inflammation.  \\n- Normal mean corpuscular volume (MCV) values (minimum 83, average 85.1) indicating normocytic anaemia.  \\n- Persistent mild-to-moderate elevations in white blood cell count (minimum 10, average 13.11, maximum 19.3) suggest inflammatory or post-operative stress response.  \\n- Elevated RDW (maximum 14.1, average 13.73).  \\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: iron deficiency anaemia, folate deficiency anaemia, haemolytic anaemia.  \\n\\n*POST-OPERATIVE LEFT PLEURAL EFFUSION AND ATELECTASIS*  \\n- Radiology findings of persistent left-sided pleural effusion, with worsening over time (noted between 5 and 95 hours after admission).  \\n- Severe left-sided and moderate right-sided atelectasis, worsening over the same period.  \\n- Reduced oxygen saturation – minimum SpO2 of 88%, average of 95.21%.  \\n- Persistent oxygen requirement based on imaging history and clinical course.  \\n- Lower lung volumes noted on imaging, consistent with atelectasis.\\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, post-operative lung contusion.\\n\\n*METABOLIC ALKALOSIS WITH RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS*  \\n- Initial arterial pH of 7.43 with elevated PCO2 of 47, indicating compensated metabolic alkalosis.  \\n- Base excess initially elevated at +6.  \\n- Subsequent pH fluctuations between alkalotic and normal ranges (7.33–7.46) associated with elevated PCO2 readings (37–55).  \\n- Lactate levels low to mildly elevated (1.1–2.4), excluding significant lactic acidosis.  \\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: renal dysfunction with acid-base imbalance, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, compensation for ongoing respiratory impairment.\\n\\n*POST-OPERATIVE INFLAMMATORY RESPONSE*  \\n- Elevated white blood cell count during hospital stay (average 13.11, maximum 19.3), consistent with post-surgical inflammatory response.  \\n- Persistently low fibrinogen at 210 mg/dL, possibly due to post-operative consumption or dilutional effects.  \\n- Chest imaging findings (pneumomediastinum, effusions, atelectasis) further supporting inflammatory response.\\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: post-surgical sepsis, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), deep surgical site infection.\\n\\n*HYPOCALCAEMIA*  \\n- Minimum calcium level of 7.9 mg/dL, average calcium level of 8.56 mg/dL (both below normal reference values).  \\n- Recent mitral valve replacement and post-operative state contributing to electrolyte imbalance.  \\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: hypoparathyroidism, vitamin D deficiency, renal insufficiency.  \\n\\n*IMPAIRED OXYGENATION WITH POSSIBLE DIFFUSION IMPAIRMENT*  \\n- Progressive decline in arterial oxygenation as demonstrated by arterial blood gas findings (PO2 decreased from 393 to 63 over the course of stay).  \\n- Reduced oxygen saturation to a minimum of 88%.  \\n- Radiological findings suggesting atelectasis and pleural effusion contributing to impaired gas exchange.  \\n\\nAlternative differentials to consider: pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), congestive heart failure.\\n\\n---\\n\\n', '*ACUTE RESPIRATORY ACIDOSIS*\\n- Arterial blood gas (20 hours after admission): pH 7.29, pCO2 50 mmHg, base excess -2, indicating primary respiratory acidosis.\\n- Evidence of bilateral atelectasis on imaging, right greater than left, which can impair ventilation.\\n- Multifocal patchy opacities in earlier imaging (suggesting atelectasis and/or aspiration).\\n- Max respiratory rate of 21 in ICU

cardiomegaly on both initial and follow-up imaging.\\n- Widening cardiomediastinal contours likely due to increased volume status.\\n- Average BUN of 36.63 mg/dL (elevated), with max BUN of 44 mg/dL
