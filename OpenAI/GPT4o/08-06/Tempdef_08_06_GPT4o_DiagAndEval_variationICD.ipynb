Value '['Based on the patient data provided, the following diagnoses and potential health concerns can be identified:\\n\\n### Diagnoses\\n\\n1. **Leukocytosis (ICD-10 Code: D72.829)**\\n   - **Foundational Data:** Max WBC: 19.5, Avg WBC: 15.08. Both values indicate elevated white blood cell count, suggesting an underlying infection or inflammatory process.\\n\\n2. **Atelectasis (ICD-10 Code: J98.11)**\\n   - **Foundational Data from Imaging Report:** \"Minimal atelectasis at the left lower lung,\" \"Minimal left atelectasis,\" and \"Bibasal areas of atelectasis are present.\"\\n   - **Further Tests:** Chest CT for detailed assessment.\\n\\n3. **Pleural Effusion, Not Elsewhere Classified (ICD-10 Code: J90)**\\n   - **Foundational Data from Imaging Report:** \"Minimal amount of bilateral pleural effusion is noted.\"\\n   - **Further Tests:** Ultrasound or CT to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent.\\n\\n4. **Signs of Hypoxemia (Without Specific ICD-10 Code)**\\n   - **Foundational Data:** Min peripheral oxygen saturation: 93.\\n   - **Further Tests:** Complete blood gas analysis to confirm any ongoing issues with oxygenation, though initial results show high PO2 levels.\\n\\n5. **Post-Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery (ICD-10 Code: Z95.1 - Presence of Aortocoronary Bypass Graft)**\\n   - **Foundational Data from Imaging Report:** \"___ year old man s/p CABG,\" \"Evaluation of the patient after CABG,\" and \"___ year old man with s/p cabg pod4.\"\\n\\n6. **Essential Hypertension (ICD-10 Code: I10)**\\n   - **Foundational Data:** Max systolic blood pressure: 135, Avg systolic blood pressure: 108.76, Max diastolic blood pressure: 95, Avg diastolic blood pressure: 72.36.
